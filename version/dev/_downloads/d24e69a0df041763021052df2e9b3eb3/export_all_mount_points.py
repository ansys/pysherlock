=======================
Export All Mount Points
=======================

This example demonstrates how to connect to the Sherlock gRPC service, import a project,
and export all mount points for a CCA.

Description
-----------
Sherlock's gRPC API allows users to automate various workflows, including exporting all
mount points for a PCB.
This script demonstrates how to:
- Connect to the Sherlock service.
- Import a tutorial project.
- Export all mount points to a CSV file.

The exported mount points can be used for further analysis or design purposes.
