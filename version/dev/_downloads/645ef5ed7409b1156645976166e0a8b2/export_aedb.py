===========
Export AEDB
===========

This example demonstrates how to connect to the Sherlock gRPC service, import a project,
and export an AEDB file for a CCA.

Description
-----------
Sherlock's gRPC API allows users to automate workflows such as exporting an AEDB file for a CCA.
This script demonstrates how to:

- Connect to the Sherlock service.
- Import a project.
- Export an AEDB file.

The exported AEDB file can be used for further analysis or integration with other software tools.
